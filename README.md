🔍 Background:
MiHotel, a mid-range hotel chain, is set for a major expansion, necessitating a more efficient applicant processing system. The current process, involving manual email submissions and file folders, is unsustainable for the anticipated influx of applications. The HR department aims to replace it with a streamlined system featuring a revised application form and a desktop application for applicant management.

🚀 Deliverables:
Final ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram):
Created using Lucidchart.
Contains CREATE and INSERT statements.
Includes dummy records to populate the database.

Excited to contribute to MiHotel's growth by developing a robust applicant processing system! 🚀 #DatabaseDesign #ERD #SQLScript #Normalization #MiHotelExpansion
